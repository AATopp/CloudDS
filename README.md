# Data Science Practicum I, II

A repository for the Regis University Data Science Cloud Project to prepare documentations for Regis University students in Data Science and Data Engineering classes.

# Description of the Project

   This project is an ongoing process of multiple steps. The environment of the project is CloudStack and created virtual machines like Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10. The goal of the project is to create a documentation in Cloud Project Regis University GitHub page for all the data science related students at Regis University to use in their classes. 
   There are currently 3 people are working on it plus one professor who guide it. To create all the documents for further students who work on the project and the students who will use them in their classes we have all different tasks. I am working on creating 2 databases PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I test databases with Yelp dataset which was downloaded from https://www.yelp.com/dataset . Using these datasets, I create tables and import data into them in Linux on Ubuntu 18.04 Virtual Machine on CloudStack. After all data stored in the tables, I am working with standard queries performed in Python so I could run multi-processing, test loading to identify how many students could run queries in those databases at the same time. 
   I am trying to represent performance under 1 set of configuration parameters for VM/server, network by analyzing CPU cores, CPU clock speed and RAM Size. Additionally, during this project we are trying to collect data that will be used to help determine hardware specifications on new equipment by load testing on created virtual machine on CloudStack. Besides hardware we need to estimate how much RAM a computer or cluster of computers would need to support 2 or 3 Data Science classes of every student was using it simultaneously.

# Description of Data 

   We work with Yelp data set in this project that was downloaded from the website: https://www.yelp.com/dataset
This dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. It was originally put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge which is a chance for students to conduct research or analysis on Yelp's data and share their discoveries. In the dataset there is information about businesses across 11 metropolitan areas in four countries.
